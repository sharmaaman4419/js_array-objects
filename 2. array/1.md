1. Create an array named colors that contains five different names of colors as strings.

```js
let colors = ["red","green","yellow","pink","brown"];
// your code goes here
```

2. Access the first color in the array and print it to the console using console.log()

```js
console.log(colors[0]);
// your code goes here
```

3.Now do the same with the third color in the list. (Remember that array indexes start at 0, not at 1!)

```js
console.log(colors[2]);
// your code goes here
```

4.Write one line of code that changes the value of the last color in the list to "ultraviolet" (overwriting the previous value).

```js
colors[4] = "ultravoilet";
// your code goes here
```

5. Create a new variable called fourthColor and set it equal to the fourth color in the list.

```js
let fourthcolor = colors[3];
// your code goes here
```

6.Add another color to the end of the list.

```js
colors[5] = "black";
// your code goes here
```

7.Add another color to the beginning of the list.

```js
colors.unshift('black');
// your code goes here
```

8. Print the length of the array to the console with console.log()

```js
console.log(colors.length);
// your code goes here
```

9.Remove the last color from the end of list, and then print the length of the array to the console one more time.

```js
colors.pop();
console.log(colors.length);
// your code goes here
```

10.Write a for loop to iterate through every color in the array and print each color's value to the console.

```js
for (let key in colors) {
    console.log(colors[key]);
}
// your code goes here
```

11.Copying from that loop you just wrote, modify it to print every color's value and every color's index in this format: 3, purple or 0, blue etc.

```js

// your code goes here
for (let color of colors) {
    console.log(colors.indexOf(color);
}
```

12.Create a variable named lastColor that will always point to the last element of the colors array, no matter how many colors are in the list. (Hint: make use of the array's length property for this!)

```js
let color = colors["length"];
// your code goes here
```
